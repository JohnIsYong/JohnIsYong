## Hi there 🌟

I go by John and I am an aspiring developer based in the Philippines.

One of my favorite feelings is when I get my program to run after encountering issues.

I mostly like to develop in Java, while I have experience with c++ and Python during University. With my current obsession being springboot rest api development.

My first finished personal project was my foreign currencies exchange rate rest api. I developed it using the https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ api.

My next project will be a spring mvc project incorporating the cat facts api.

Fun facts:
  - I love cats
  - The game that had the most impact on my life was Omori
  - My passion for the Japanese language stemmed from anime but now-a-days I can't bring myself to watch new animes
